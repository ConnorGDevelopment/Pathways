# Upload Your Resume to Quinncia

## What:

### **Now that you have learned what makes a good resume and have written a resume, you will put your resume to the test through Quinncia.**

### **Quinncia is an AI software that will analyze your resume and give you feedback on how to improve. Take the improvements and re-submit your resume, up to 10 times. We will use Quinncia in the future for mock interviews, as well.**

## Do:

1. Check your email for an invite from Quinncia. Click the link and sign in. *If the link does not work in your email, you can navigate to Quinncia by going to <https://www.hocking.edu/job-search>, scrolling down, clicking the yellow link, and signing in with your Hocking information.*
2. Create your Qunncia profile by selecting your correct major, graduation year, etc.
3. Upload a resume to your profile **and follow the steps to improve it.** Your goal should be to reduce the number of red flags and take all of their improvements.

You must submit and improve your resume at least twice. Quinncia will always give you improvements on your resume, no matter how good it is, so donâ€™t worry if there are still flags on your resume. However, your resume must follow the rules Bob discussed in class in order to get the most possible points.
