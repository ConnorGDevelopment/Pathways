# GROUP A Career Fair Assignment Instructions: READ if you are in Group A

## Group A: Still Preparing for Employment in their Field

### You are in group A if ANY of the following are true:

- You are under 21 years of age **AND** are **NOT** graduating in *December 2020*
- You *have not yet been paid for a job* in your desired field **AND** are *not ready to accept a job* set to start in November/December 2020 or January 2021
- You are not sure which career you want to pursue

### **Students in this group are still going to be students for a few more months/years and/or are not prepared to look for and accept full-time, professional employment.**

## Group A: Assignment Instructions: Instead of going to the Career Fair, your assignment will be to conduct TWO Informational Interviews

### Why?

As you learned in Week 10, Informational Interviews are an excellent way to *build your network* and to *learn what you didn't know you didn't know*. Yes, you read that right. You won't know what a job is like until you do it. But you can certainly clarify what it might be like for you by speaking to someone in the field.

### How will I do this Informational Interview?

### **Step 1: Determine what kinds of professionals you are interested in interviewing.**

- If you are sure you want to be a forester, and you are in the forestry program, you should interview forestry professionals.
- If you don't know what career you want to pursue, you should interview a couple of different professionals.
  - For example, if you think you want to work with people, consider interviewing a teacher and a librarian, or a teacher and a nurse.

### **Step 2: Find individuals to interview.**

Research potential interviewee's professional backgrounds on LinkedIn. Here are some places to look for individuals to interview:

- Hocking College
  - Professors
  - Staff
  - Academic Advisors
  - Your supervisor
- Your High School
  - Teachers
  - Coaches
- Family / Friends
  - Extended family
  - Friends of your family
  - Siblings
  - Neighbors
  - Spouse/ spouses' coworkers

*If you are struggling to come up with people to interview, ask yourself the following questions. I bet you will realize you have more resources than you originally thought you had:*

- Is there an aunt/uncle/cousin in my family who performs a related job in my field? Could my parent/sibling/grandmother give me more information on my extended family so that I could find someone in the family to interview?

- What do my neighbors do in my hometown? Could my parents give me more information on what my neighbors do?

- What did my academic advisor do before they got this job at Hocking? Could my academic advisor point me to more contacts?

*If you choose to interview an immediate family member (someone you lived with growing up), make sure your second interview is with a non-family member.*

### **Step 3: Ask those individuals if they would have time to do a 10-20 minute informational interview with you.**

Appropriate ways of asking are by...

- a professional email
- a LinkedIn message
- a phone call (if you already know them)

*Be prepared*

- for them to say no, especially if they are a professor or program manager.
- to suggest three different times and dates during which you are available
- to suggest a meeting style. Any of the below meeting styles are acceptable:
  - in person
  - over the phone
  - over Zoom / Google Meet

*A sample email request is below:*

Dear [Interviewee's Name],

Though we have never met in person, I see that you both work at Hocking College and have a background in __[the field they work(ed) in]_. I am studying to enter a similar field and am performing informational interviews to gain more information on this field. Would you be open to a 10-20 minute phone interview in the next two weeks? I am available at noon on 10/30, 11/5, and 11/10.

Thanks,

Your Name

Your Phone Number

Your email

*Of course, EDIT this email to make it sound like you and fit your goals of the informational interview. This is simply an example to get you started.*

### **Step 4: Schedule the interview on your google calendar and invite the interviewee as a guest.**

Missing the interview is an automatic failure on your part.

### **Step 5: Prepare more than enough interview questions.**

They should be specific to your interviewee's experience and your interest in their work.

Your goal is to learn from them and their experience.

Your interview should last at least 10 minutes.

*Questions you might start with:*

- Tell me about yourself and your career.
- What made you choose [Nursing / Teaching / Career name]?
- What kind of education did you go through in order to enter this career?

*Other questions to ask:*

- What would you tell a young person who is interested in entering this field today?
- What are the most common challenges you experience, working in this career?
- Do you know of anyone else that would be a good connection for me?

### *Step 6: Host the interview*

Be sure to...

- Be early or right on time
- Have headphones with a mic ready for phone/video calls
- Have your questions list ready, in asking order
- Have a notepad and pen ready
- *Take brief notes during the interview (See step 8).*
- Use your interview exit strategy to...
  - Thank your interviewee
  - Plan any follow-up meetings, if necessary
  - Keep the relationship between you and this person strong

### **Step 7: Immediately after the interview, record your initial thoughts** so you have data to write your reflection.

### **Step 8: Write your reflection** on your interview in the Week 14 Career Fair + Assignment. **Please type your interview notes and attach them with your reflection**.

Your reflection should *be...*

- 350 words at least
- Written in proper sentence format.
- Either a Word Doc or typed directly into the editor.

Your reflection should *include...*

- Your interviewee's names, job title, and career history
- The date and time you met, and what format
- A summary of what you discussed/ learned
- Your key insights, takeaways, etc.
- The exit strategy you used.
- Any plans for future meetings or a follow-up.

**Your interviews and reflection must be turned in by the end of Week 14 if you want a grade on it. No late assignments will be accepted for the last three weeks of class (Week s 14, 15, and 16).**
