# Career Fair: Do I Need to Go?

## Do I need to go to the Career Fair on November 4th?

### The answer is maybe or maybe not, depending on where you are in your college career.

Your professor has created three different assignment expectations, designed to best serve your needs and knowledge gaps. She has sorted you based on "Group."

You will complete the Career Fair Assignment Instructions that match your group. For example, if Group A describes you, then you will complete the "Group A Career Fair Assignment Instructions".

To determine your group, you should have done the Week 10 before class assignment. To reiterate the groups and clarify any confusion, read the group descriptions, below.
