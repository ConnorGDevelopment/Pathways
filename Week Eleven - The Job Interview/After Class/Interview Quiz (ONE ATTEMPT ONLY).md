I am particularly interested in the ways your company integrates 21st century literacy skills like email and MS Office Suite skills into all of their adult literacy courses, not just their computer literacy courses.**
  - Nonprofit work is where my heart resides. I have worked with other Literacy programs in the past, so I have been following Cincinnati Literacy Company for a while.
