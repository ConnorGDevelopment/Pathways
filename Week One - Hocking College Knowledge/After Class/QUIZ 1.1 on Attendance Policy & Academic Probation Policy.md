**Attendance (page 16 of Course Catalog)**  

Student attendance in all class types and settings is critical for student success.
Failure to attend class and be actively engaged will not only jeopardize the student’s ability to be successful in the classroom, it could also result in the student being dropped from the class.

**Attendance Policy**

Students are expected to attend all classes to ensure academic success. Instructors will report attendance in each class using the following categories: Present, Absent, Absent Excused and Late. Attendance will be reported and/or updated each week by Sunday at midnight. Failure to attend will result in the following:

Following the 15th calendar day of the semester, a student who has never attended a course(s) will be Administratively Dropped from the course(s).

16 - week courses

- Upon the 4th absence, a student will be Administratively Dropped from the course(s).
