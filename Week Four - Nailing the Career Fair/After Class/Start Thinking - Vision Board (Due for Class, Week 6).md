## What:
A vision board is typically an informal way to piece together symbols and words that show where you want your life to go. Look up "Vision Board" on YouTube and you can find tons of DIY tutorials on how to "manifest your dreams" with vision boarding.

For our class, I understand not all of you want to get crafty with glitter glue. That's OK. However, all of you should be interested in thinking about what you want from life; this is your chance to put it into a tangible collection of ideas, which you can return to whenever you need a reminder of why you're here.

This board will be presented in class in week 6; you will use it as a springboard for writing your mission statement and elevator pitch, as well.

## Think:
Vision boards are usually visual, hence, vision. However, not all of you will want to draw it out, print out pictures, or cut out magazine scraps. So I'm open to letting you choose a different format. It's about your thought and engagement behind the final product that matters the most.

So, what format do you like creating in the most?

Below are some other kinds of "vision boards" you could make for class, based on the format you like:
- A written vision statement -- a one page written letter or speech to yourself that explains what you want out of life. "I am here to..." "I envision a life in which..." "My ideal life looks like..." are good starter sentences.
- An audio vision board -- a playlist of songs that encompass your ideal life. Each song might have a particular meaning to you, or they might all work together to remind you of the person you want to be. **To get full credit for this option, EACH SONG must have at least a one-sentence explanation as to how it reminds you of what you are striving for in life. You must have at least 12 songs.

## Do:
1. Decide which format you'll use.
2. Start researching vision boards to get an idea of what you'll want to include on yours.
3. Review your pre-class journal and after-class assignment for week 3 to get some ideas of what you want out of life; start thinking about how you'll represent it on your board/in your statement/ in your audio selection, etc.
4. Start creating!

**To be uploaded and presented in WEEK 6 of our class for 30 points.**
