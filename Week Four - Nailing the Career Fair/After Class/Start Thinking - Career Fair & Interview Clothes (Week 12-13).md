## Think:

- **What do you already have that could pass for professional clothes?**
  - Ex: A blouse that you wear to school sometimes could probably work fine under a blazer for the career fair; a button down that you might wear to church or to see your grandparents will also likely be fine for the career fair.
  - For our virtual fair, you only (really) need to worry about a professional top, as you will only be seen from the waist up. However,
- **How soon will you be looking for a "real" job?**
  - If you are graduating soon, or are just here for a semester, you'll need professional clothes, soon!
  - If you won't graduate for two years, don't invest now in the most expensive pair of dress shoes; your size and style preference could change.
