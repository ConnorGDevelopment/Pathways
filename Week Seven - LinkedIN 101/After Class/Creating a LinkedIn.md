# Creating a LinkedIn

## LinkedIn: The Facebook for Your Professional Life & Network

## WHAT:

### This week, you will create a profile on <http://www.linkedin.com/> with the following elements:

1. Profile Picture: Professional
2. About section: Elevator pitch works well here
3. Education: Your current & past education
4. Skill: At least 5 skills in this section
5. Groups: Join/follow one group (Ex: Hocking College)
6. Experience: List at least one related work/volunteer experience

## THINK:

### It is essential to listen up to Stephen's presentation in-class and take notes, as he will show you how to properly choose the content for each of the elements, A-F, above.

## DO:

### To "turn in" this assignment, you need to do TWO THINGS:

1. Ask to connect with the Hawking Hawk; see the profile screenshot below.
2. Copy and paste your unique LinkedIn Profile link in the editor, below these instructions.
    1. You can find this link by scrolling to the middle or end of your profile in the Contact section and copying your profile link.
    2. You could use this link in a Job Search Engine profile in the future, or in a professional email signature, as a way for other people to find you.

**You are welcome to request to connect with your instructor, Allison Nowak, or Stephen Powell, today's guest lecturer, as well, to begin growing your network.**
