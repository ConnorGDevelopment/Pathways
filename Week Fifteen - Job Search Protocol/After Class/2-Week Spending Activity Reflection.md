# 2-Week Spending Activity Reflection

## So, you all kept track of your spending over the past two weeks. In the discussion, below, let us know what you have noticed from keeping track of your spending.

### **You definitely don't need to give us specific dollar amounts, as your finances are private. Instead, this is a space to discuss something we could all likely improve upon: money mindfulness.**

Some questions your discussion post might answer:

1. How did you keep track of your spending? What program, if any, did you use?
2. What did you expect to spend the majority of your income on? Did your expectations match reality?
3. What surprised you during/after this activity?
4. Are you pleased with your spending habits? Why or why not?
5. Do you have any saving/spending goals? Are you trying to save up for a car or a trip?
6. What are you general spending/saving plans going forward?
