# Formal Etiquette Dinner Activity & Reflection

## Purpose:

Since we cannot attend a formal etiquette dinner in times of distance learning and COVID, I have provided some helpful videos that will act as reinforcement to Dr. Young's document.

Many of you are nurses and police officers who are unlikely to be interviewed in a formal dinner scenario. However, you never know when you might be invited to a formal event. I welcome you to save these videos in your browser's bookmarks, should that situation arise.

(If you are a parent, it can be especially fun to pull out your etiquette knowledge when having tea parties and such with your child(ren). The fancier, the merrier.)

## Watch:
