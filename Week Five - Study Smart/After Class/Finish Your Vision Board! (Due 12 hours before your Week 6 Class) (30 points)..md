# Finish Your Vision Board! (Due 12 hours before your Week 6 Class) (30 points).

## Your vision board is due 12 hours before your Week 6 class time. Turn it in by submitting it to the assignment in the BEFORE CLASS folder for Week 6.

## Your board/playlist/writing/slide will be presented in class as an activity for Week 6.

(The way we will do this is by compiling all of your submissions into a PowerPoint, which the Guest Lecturer will present (without names). Your peers will analyze your vision board and throw out some key words that comes to mind when they look at it (Ex: education, money, creativity, family). You will have the chance to use those words for your Week 6 assignment. )

## If you haven't made it yet, it is time to get creative!

**Student's Explanation:**  
"The word MAGNIFICENT is how I want to live my life. As someone who's rare and beautiful that is willing to help others and help them understand they have a purpose. And as long as they have breathe they can and will be MAGNIFICENT. The Army Falcon Jet represents the speed in which move when I focus.The Private Jet is my desire to become successful and build a legacy for my family as I travel the world. The wedding rings is marriage. The image below the rings is a mansion on the Hills. The luxurious life. The bulb with half brain represents my favorite quote "knowledge is power, and with power comes great responsibility" the power to shape the world and make it a better place. The cars - Range Rover, Bugatti, and Rolls Royce. The suit - A businessman, entrepreneur, husband, and father. And it all put together by the road. All these things are in front of me. I know it's not going to be an easy road. But the journey is worth as long as I keep focused and have this vision board to help me."
