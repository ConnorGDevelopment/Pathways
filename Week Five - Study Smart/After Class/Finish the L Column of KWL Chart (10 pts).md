# Finish the "L" Column of KWL Chart (10 pts.)

## We started the KWL chart in class; finish the "L" column (Question 3) by Sunday at 11:59pm for full points.

**Remember, "L" is what you learned about the given topic for which you are using the KWL chart.**  
If you have no idea what this means, open the document in the during class folder. That's where you need to go. Answer Question 1 as you would fill in your "Know" column; answer Question 2 as you would the "Want to Know" column; answer what you learned in Question 3.
