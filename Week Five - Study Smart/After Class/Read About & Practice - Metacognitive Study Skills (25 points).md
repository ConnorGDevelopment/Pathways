# Read About & Practice: Metacognitive Study Skills (25 points).

## Read: "Metacognitive Study Strategies" from The Learning Center of UNC Chapel Hill (Reading time: 10 minutes).

Link: <https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/metacognitive-study-strategies/>
*Have you read the article and still don't understand the concept of metacognition? Consider watching this interview with Dr. Sandra McGuire, a metacognition expert, and author of* Teach Yourself How to Learn: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_b44JaBQ-Q> (Watch time: 4 minutes).

## Then...

### What (10-120 mins):

You will *apply one* of the Metacognitive Study Strategies to a learning situation in your life. You will upload a record that shows how you applied the strategy to get credit.

### Think:

1. What class do you need to focus on the most? (Ex: Anatomy).
2. Then, what assignment(s) do you have for that class this week? Pick one area to focus on. (Ex: Chapter 8 of my Anatomy textbook).
3. Finally, what would be the best learning strategy from the article to apply to your selected assignment? (Ex: Take Notes from Memory.)

## Do:

1. Practice your learning strategy (actually do it!)
2. Take pictures of how you applied it (if you did it by hand). If you used writing, you are welcome to type that into the editor.
3. Upload those pictures/documents/etc. to share how you applied your selected learning strategy.

*If you choose a learning strategy like a Think Aloud, for example, you can totally upload an MP3 file of yourself talking aloud on the subject.*

*If you choose a learning strategy like a graphic organizer, and you do it on your computer, a digital file is fine as long as it is in PowerPoint/Word so I can download and see it.*

*If you choose to "Use Writing," you can type out your writing rather than uploading a document, if you wish.*

## EXAMPLES of EXCELLENT APPLICATIONS OF THE SOME LEARNING STRATEGIES ARE BELOW. Feel free to draw, record yourself, use tools (like sticky notes/diagrams), etc.
