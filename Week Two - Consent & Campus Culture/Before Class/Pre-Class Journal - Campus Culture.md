# Pre-Class Journal: Campus Culture
## Journal Prompt
---
**Below is a prompt I want you to use to guide you in your reflection. Thinking about these topics before class will help you get prepared for class meeting this week.**

### **College Campus**  
What is important to you regarding your college campus? What should any college campus have/be, no matter what?

Of course, during COVID, nothing is really how we expected, when we began this year. You are welcome to use this space to write about what you miss from our campus during this pandemic, BUT I want you to look beyond COVID.

*Think big picture: what should all campuses have, be, or do for its students?*

*Then, think: how is my campus or other campuses I have experienced living up or not living up to my desires?*

You are welcome to interpret the questions in any way that you see fit. There are no right or wrong answers, as long as you think and then write out your thoughts.
