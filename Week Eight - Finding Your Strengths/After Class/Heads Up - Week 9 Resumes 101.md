# Heads Up: Week 9 Resumes 101

## Have you ever written a resume?

### Most of you probably have, but some of you might have only done one, once, in high school, and it might not be your best work.

### If you have any sort of resume hiding in your old computer files, consider fishing it out for reference during the week 9 class.

### If you have never written a resume, you don't need to do anything to prepare for week 9.

### The after-class assignment for week 9 will give you a chance to write and/or improve your resume, something all of us could do!
