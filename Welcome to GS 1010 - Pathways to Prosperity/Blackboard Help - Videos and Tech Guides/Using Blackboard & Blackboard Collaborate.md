<h1>Blackboard Collaborate (Virtual Meeting) Troubleshooting Help:</h1>

<h2>My Bb Collaborate Course Room Won't Load/ I Can't Join: </h2>
<ol>
    <li>Be sure you're using Chrome as your browser, not Microsoft Edge.</li>
    <li>Try joining the meeting without your camera on.</li>
    <li>Can you load other webpages and tabs? --> If you can't, that is likely an internet connection problem, not a Bb problem.</li>
</ol>

<h2>No one else is in the Bb Course Room:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Is it the right time for the meeting?</li>
    <li>Were you supposed to enter a scheduled meeting or the Course Room? (Scheduled meetings will display as a second option in the drop down "Join Session" list.)</li>
    <li>Did your instructor or tutor send a separate link to join?</li>
    <li>Are you in the right course? --> Each course has a different Course Room.</li>
</ol>
