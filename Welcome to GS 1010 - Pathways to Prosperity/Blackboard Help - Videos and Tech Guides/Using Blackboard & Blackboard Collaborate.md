# Blackboard Collaborate (Virtual Meeting) Troubleshooting Help:

## My Bb Collaborate Course Room Won't Load / I Can't Join:

1. Be sure you're using Chrome as your browser, not Microsoft Edge.
2. Try joining the meeting without your camera on.
3. Can you load other webpages and tabs? --> If you can't, that is likely an internet connection problem, not a Bb problem.

## No one else is in the Bb Course Room:

1. Is it the right time for the meeting?
2. Were you supposed to enter a scheduled meeting or the Course Room? (Scheduled meetings will display as a second option in the drop down "Join Session" list.)
3. Did your instructor or tutor send a separate link to join?
4. Are you in the right course? --> Each course has a different Course Room.
