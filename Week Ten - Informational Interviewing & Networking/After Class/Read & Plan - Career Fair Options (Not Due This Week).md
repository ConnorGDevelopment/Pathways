# Read & Plan: Career Fair Options (Not Due This Week)

## What:

**Many of you have perfectly good reasons for wanting to, somewhat wanting to, and not wanting to attend the Career Fair. Notably, if you aren't ready to take a job right now, we would appreciate it if you not waste employer's time. *On the other hand, if you are actively looking for work, you should absolutely attend the career fair.***

**This document will show you what is expected of you regarding the original career fair assignment, based on your current position in life.**

***NOTE: The Career Fair is only mandatory for some of you.***

## Think:

**In the before class assignment, which description, A, B, or C best described you?**

**Given which category (A, B, or C) you best fall into, follow the assignment prompts below. You must follow the assignment prompt that matches you if you want full points.**

## Do:

### A Category: Under 21 years of age

*You haven't had experience in your field and/or you aren't completely sure you will like your field, so your assignment is to perform TWO Informational Interviews* over the next couple of weeks with individuals who work in fields you might want to work in. You do not need to go to the career fair.

Even if you are absolutely sure you want to become a forester, for example, these informational interviews are an excellent opportunity to expand your network and learn what you didn't know you didn't know. (Like if there are certifications you should get to open your job opportunities, or that the best place to live for forestry jobs is in Idaho, for example.) It is always a good idea to make meaningful connections with individuals who could help you on your way.

*You will submit a record of your informational interviews, indicating who you met with, when you met, as well as your questions and their answers. You will perform a short reflection on both interviews,* as well. These interviews will be due **SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 22nd, at 11:59PM, in the Week 14 Folder. This will give you time to coordinate schedules with your interviewees.**

**The official assignment will be posted later this week, in the Week 10, after class folder, with the above due date.**

*You are welcome to apply to meet with employers who might be offering internships. Right now, we do not have the data on which employers will be offering internships, or the percentage of internship offerings vs. full-time job offerings expected at the career fair.*

### B Category: At least 22 years of age AND don't want a new job.

You have had plenty of experience in your career and you are not in school to change careers. You also still have a job that you plan to keep.

Your assignment is neither to attend the career fair nor to perform informational interviews, as neither of those are relevant to you. Instead, *you are to attend one of the Career Center's workshops in the upcoming weeks, and write a reflection on what you learned. You will also attach your current job description complete with three things you are either grateful for about your job or three things that you like about your job.* **This will be due SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 22nd at 11:59 PM, in the Week 14 Folder.**

*You are welcome to attend more than one workshop for up to 10 bonus points and/or offer yourself to others as a source for informational interviewing.*

### C Category: At least 21+ years old AND want a new job.

You are close to graduation and are ready to get a job. The Career Fair is for you. Your assignment will be to sign up with InternX (information to come) and to indicate interest with the employers with whom you might like to work. Try to land an interview with at least 5 of them. If you get accepted for any interviews, attend those, interview, and record a reflection in the assignment. This assignment will be due **SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 22nd at 11:59PM, in the Week 14 Folder.**

*If you apply to many interviews, but do not get accepted, you must set up a Career Coaching appointment at the Career Center, instead. You will do a mock interview with one of the Career Services individuals and can explain how you applied via InternX, but were not selected. They might have recommendations for you to improve your application skills. You will reflect on that experience, instead.*

**QUESTIONS? Bring them to the Week 11 in-class meeting.**

Please do not email them.

**AND ABSOLUTELY DO NOT** email them to nowaka@hocking.edu, as the email for this class is homework.pathways@hocking.edu.

Thanks for your cooperation and respect of your instructors' time.
