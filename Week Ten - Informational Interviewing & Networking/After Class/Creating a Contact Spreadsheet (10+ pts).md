# Creating a Contact Spreadsheet (10+ pts)

## Purpose:

To perform an effective job search, it helps to know people. To build a successful career, it helps to keep getting to know more people

## Think:

Who do you know who might be a good contact for your job search and your career beyond?

And/or, who might you be able to meet for that purpose?

**Example:** If you are in the nursing program, your nursing instructors would certainly be excellent contacts and references. Further, your past volunteering experience at a nursing home introduced you to many people. List your volunteer coordinator and any workers you came to know well.

You can also search LinkedIN for professionals working in your field, locally. Who has the position you want, right down the road or in your hometown? List that person as someone you could reach out to in the future.

**Example:** I'm a new librarian. In my contact list, I list the director of OhioNET, a non-profit company that connects public, school, and academic libraries to each other. The director and I spoke on the phone the other day and she expressed her willingness to answer my questions. She is going to be a great contact for me; I might run into her at a future conference; she might even be a future employer.

**Example:** As a librarian in Ohio, I also work with OhioLINK, a similar organization. Though I haven't personally met those directors, I could still list them as contacts and plan to reach out to them in the future, especially since they will be at the yearly OhioLINK conferences.

*NOTE: If you are well into your career, and you don't plan on changing your field or job anytime soon, I welcome you to include some individuals in your list that you might be able to be a contact for. Who might you be able to mentor?*

## Do:

Now that you are thinking about who you could contact, it is time to start compiling that list and gathering their information.

1. Download the attached MS Excel document (below) to your computer and save a copy.
2. Using your selected repository, input all the names and contact information from your classmates, co-workers, conference contacts,instructors, etc. that may be able to help you become employed in the future.  
3. You must complete at least 12 contacts and include personal information about how you met them, where you met them or who they work for so you will remember who they are 10 years from now.
