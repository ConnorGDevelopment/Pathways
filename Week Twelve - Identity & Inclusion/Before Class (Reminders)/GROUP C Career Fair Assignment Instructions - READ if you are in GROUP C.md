## Group C: Looking for Employment in their Field

### **You are in group C if either of the following is true:**

- You are above 21 years of age AND are ready to apply for, accept, and start a “real-world” professional job in December 2020 or January 2021.
- You are graduating in December 2020 AND are ready to apply for, accept, and start a “real-world” professional job in December 2020 or January 2021.

*Students in this group are actively looking for full-time, professional employment.*

### **Attending the Career Fair is required unless you have already emailed homework.pathways@hocking.edu with your schedule conflict.**

The Hocking College Virtual Fair will be on November 4 from 10AM-2PM EDT. During this time, students will have 10-15 minute time slots (depending on company choice) with recruiters to have virtual video calls.

Recruiters will use InternX's built-in video solution or will provide a link for you to use their own video conferencing application.

### **Instructions for Attending the Career Fair:**

### **Part 1: Follow the steps below to create your InternX account.**

1. **Create an InternX profile [here](https://app.theinternx.com/sign-up/new/welcome), and make sure your profile is up to date with your latest information.** This is what recruiters will be looking at to see your resume and experiences.

2. **Check out the Job Postings** that companies add by clicking on your "Career Fairs" tab and then selecting the "Jobs" tab. Recruiters will be adding jobs in the upcoming days so check back later for job postings. You can message employers through those postings if you are interested.

3. **Accept any recruiter invites** that you receive through the link in your email. Recruiters will begin to send invites shortly.

4. **Open scheduling for companies will begin on October 28 at 9 am EDT.** At that time, you can schedule a meeting during available time slots. As a reminder, these are first come, first serve.
    1. *If you do not get to schedule a meeting with a company you are interested in, "save" that company and check on the day of the fair for any meeting cancellations. Openings may appear that you can fill.*

5. If you still want to learn more about a company and did not have the chance to meet with them, check their company description to see what steps you should take to let the company know that you are interested.

**If you have any questions, there is an intercom chat box in the lower right hand corner of the InternX website.**

### **Part 2: Go to the interview(s) for which you are accepted.**

***It is incredibly rude to not show up to an interview, and your lack of attendance may ruin the relationship between Hocking College and that employer. Not showing up is NOT ACCEPTABLE.***

### **Part 3: Complete a 350-word reflection on your interview process after interviewing on Nov. 4th.**

**This will be due during Week 14 and will be submitted in the After Class folder.**

**Your assignment should answer some of the following questions in paragraph form, do not submit a list of one-sentence responses.**

- Which employers did you apply to interview with?
- How many accepted your interview requests?
- How did you prepare for your interview with the employer?
- Who did you interview with? For what company? For what job? If multiple, reflect on each.
- What was the interview process like?
- What questions did they ask you?
- How did you answer their questions?
- What would you do differently if you were to interview again?
