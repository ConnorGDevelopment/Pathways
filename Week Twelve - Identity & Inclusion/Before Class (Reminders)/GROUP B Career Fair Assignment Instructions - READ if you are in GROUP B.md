# GROUP B Career Fair Assignment Instructions: READ if you are in GROUP B

## Group B: Currently Employed in their Field

### **You are in group B if the following is true:**

- You are above 21 years of age and *are currently working* in a long-term professional job that is **BOTH** in your desired career field **AND** in line with your job desires.

*Students in this group are not looking for a new job.*

## Group B: Assignment Instructions: Instead of going to the Career Fair, your assignment will be to conduct TWO Informational Interviews

### **How will I do this Informational Interview?**

### **Step 1: Determine what kinds of professionals you are interested in interviewing.**

As you are already in your career, you probably already know what kind of people you should talk to in order to advance your career.

The goal is to interview someone who can either help you advance your career or help you develop professionally.

- A good example for a Nurse would be to interview a supervisor about their responsibilities or to interview a colleague that works in a different unit.

*If you interview a direct coworker for one of your informational interviews, your other informational interview should be with someone of a different position or from an adjacent industry.*

### **Step 2: Ask those individuals if they would have time to do a *10-20 minute* informational interview with you.**

Appropriate ways of asking are by...

- a professional email
- a LinkedIn message
- a phone call (if you already know them)

*Be prepared*

- for them to say no, especially if they are a professor or program manager.
- to suggest *three different times and dates during which you are available*
- to suggest a meeting style. Any of the below meeting styles are acceptable:
  - in person
  - over the phone
  - over Zoom / Google Meet

*A sample email request is below:*

Dear [Interviewee's Name],

Though we have never met in person, I see that you both work at Hocking College and have a background in __[the field they work(ed) in]_. I am studying to enter a similar field, so I am performing informational interviews to learn more about my field. Would you be open to a 10-20 minute phone interview in the next two weeks? I am available at noon on 10/30, 11/5, and 11/10.

Thanks,

Your Name

Your Phone Number

Your email

*Edit this email template to sound like you, fit your true goals, and to remove the brackets [ ] .*

### **Step 3: Schedule the interview on your google calendar** and invite the interviewee as a guest.

Missing the interview is an automatic failure on your part.

### **Step 4: Prepare more than enough interview questions.**

They should be specific to your interviewee's experience and your interest in their work.

Your goal is to learn from them and their experience.

Your interview should last at least 10 minutes.

### **Step 5: Host the interview**

Be sure to...

- Be early or right on time
- Have headphones with a mic ready for phone/video calls
- Have your questions list ready, in asking order
- Have a notepad and pen ready
- *Take brief notes during the interview (See step 8)*.
- Use your interview exit strategy to...
- Thank your interviewee
- Plan any follow-up meetings, if necessary
- Keep the relationship between you and this person strong

### **Step 6: Immediately after the interview, record your initial thoughts** so you have data to write your reflection.

### **Step 7: Write your reflection** on your interview in the Week 14 Career Fair + Assignment. **Please type your interview notes and attach them with your reflection**.

Your reflection should *be...*

- 350 words at least
- Written in proper sentence format.
- Either a Word Doc or typed directly into the editor.

Your reflection should *include...*

- Your interviewee's names, job title, and career history
- The date and time you met, and what format
- A summary of what you discussed/ learned
- Your key insights, takeaways, etc.
- The exit strategy you used.
- Any plans for future meetings or a follow-up.
