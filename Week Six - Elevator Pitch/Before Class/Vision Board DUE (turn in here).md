## What:

### You've known about the vision board since Week 3. Now is your chance to show us what you've created.

Examples of proper-looking submissions can be found in the Week 5, After Class, "Finish Your Vision Board" document.

## DO:

### Upload your vision board as a viewable picture, pdf., PowerPoint, etc., in the editor, below, at least 12 hours BEFORE class. Acceptable files are: .png, .docx, .pdf, .pptx, .jpg, and .jpeg.
