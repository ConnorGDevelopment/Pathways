# Write Your Elevator Pitch

## What:

### **An elevator pitch is a quick, brief, and specific summary of who you are. Typically, you would give this when you introduce yourself and shake hands in an elevator, or at a career fair.**

## Think:

**Use the Formula for your elevator pitch, as discussed in class:**

1. Who are you
2. Little bit of background
3. Provide context
4. Connection
5. Ask
6. Close out

## Do:

1. Consider using the words you noted from the Week 6 class to build your elevator pitch, along with the formula, above.
2. Review the video from class if you forget what the formula means.
3. Type out your edited, well-crafted 30-second elevator pitch in the editor below, or upload a file in a .docx, .doc, .pdf, .jpeg, or .png format.
