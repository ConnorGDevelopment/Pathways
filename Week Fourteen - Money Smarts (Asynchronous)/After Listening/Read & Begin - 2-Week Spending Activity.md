# Read & Begin: 2-Week Spending Activity

## Control Your Budget, Control Your Life

### What:

### **For this week and next week, you will track all of your personal cashflow (money in & money out).**

This means you count your paycheck as an addition and any spending on groceries/rent/restaurants as a subtraction.

The goal is to help you become aware of your spending habits. You will reflect on this 2-week activity in the week 15 discussion board.

### DO:

**There is no requirement to post your record of your cashflow, as many people want to keep this information private. Your instructor has no interest in knowing your spending habits; she does want YOU to know them, though.**

**All that is required is that you do the activity on your own so you can participate fully in the Week 15 discussion board.**

If you aren't sure how to track your spending, you need to either start writing down each transaction you make or start recording it from you bank account(s).

### HOWEVER...

**A few of you have asked for extra credit assignments. I have very limited resources for creating and grading these kinds of assignments. However, I can offer bonus for this assignment. It will be the last bonus opportunity for the semester.**

**To earn bonus points for this assignment, up to a 10/0 (10 bonus points), you are to submit a detailed budget in the following budget tracking template, complete with a monthly budget plan and at least one out of the two weeks of spending. I will not accept any alternative budget tracker templates for this assignment.**

**If you choose to submit a detailed budget for bonus points...**
**You must:**

- Have accurate transactions spanning the two-week period
        - Example transaction entry: 11/18/2020 Wendy's (Restaurants) $-4.19
        - Note that it includes the date, place, category of spending, and exact deduction amount
- Have multiple transaction entries
- Have a monthly budget split into categories of spending/saving/income, complete with goal dollar amounts for each section
  - Example of category with subcategory and goal dollar amount for the month:
    - HOME
      - Rent $500
      - Internet $45
      - Gas $80
      - Electric $35
      - Water $28
      - Repairs & Misc $40
- Uses the 50/30/20 rule (or your own defined set amount to spend, save, etc.)
- Submit a copy of the above template in Excel. Do not submit a Google Sheets file. It will not be counted.

*If you have less clearly-defined goal dollar amounts, not enough categories to accurately guide your spending, etc., you may lose points.*

*You won't be penalized if you set a budget with discretionary spending goals that you end up exceeding in the two weeks. This assignment is not designed to force you to stick to your budget; but, rather, help you become aware of where your money is going and how you can better plan for the financial life you want.*

**IF YOU ARE NOT CHOOSING TO DO THE BONUS PORTION OF THE ASSIGNMENT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO SUBMIT ANYTHING, HERE. YOU WILL SIMPLY REFLECT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT IN THE WEEK 15 DISCUSSION BOARD POSTED IN THE AFTER-CLASS FOLDER.**
